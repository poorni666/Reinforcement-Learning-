# Wordle Reinforcement Learning Agent

A reinforcement learning agent trained to solve [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) using the **Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C)** algorithm. This project was developed as part of my Reinforcement Learning final exam, demonstrating how an RL agent can learn effective Wordle strategies from scratch.
